                <li>Our group’s design project is an external mounted wheelchair stair climbing device. This device can be installed on traditional wheelchairs, aiming to help elderly people overcome the problem of stairs in areas without wheelchair access and residential buildings without elevators.</li>            
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>We recognize that stairs are a huge challenge for people with limited mobility. And our equipment will provide them with a convenient solution. This device adopts advanced technology and can help wheelchair users safely and stably climb and descend stairs.</li>            
            </ul>
        </dd>

        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>Our device has the following characteristics: firstly, it is externally mounted and can be compatible with various types of traditional wheelchairs, without the need to replace the entire wheelchair. Secondly, our device adopts an intelligent control system that can perform precise operations based on user actions and intentions. In addition, it is equipped with an efficient battery system to ensure long-term use and stability.</li>

        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>Our goal is to provide a reliable, safe, and easy-to-use solution that allows people with limited mobility to move and participate in social activities more freely. Through our design, we hope to improve their quality of life and enable them to independently cope with accessibility challenges. Our team will actively develop and test this device, and collaborate with relevant institutions and communities to ensure that our design meets user needs and truly solves their problems with stairs. We believe that through our efforts and innovation, we can bring positive impacts to people with limited mobility and bring more tolerance and care to society.</li>

        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>During our first meeting, our mentor provided us with an overview of key factors to ensure the successful completion of our device’s designated tasks. The mentor also emphasized the importance of understanding the purpose and functionality of the device, and encouraged us to identify and confirm the specific tasks the device needs to accomplish. Through in-depth discussions, we were able to compile detailed descriptions and plans for each component. The process did not involve extensive research but rather relied on the prompts and guidelines provided by the mentor. We believe that this process was necessary to ensure that our device can achieve its objectives and meet the needs of the intended users.</li>

        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>During the second meeting, we worked together with our mentor to confirm the precise design direction and had in-depth discussions about our overall objectives. We explored various possible solutions and carefully assessed the pros and cons of each option. We also discussed the feasibility of the design, technical requirements, and time constraints. Through collective brainstorming, we arrived at a clear design goal. In this meeting, we selected one out of the three pre-determined topics that best met the requirements for our graduation project, which was the development of an external wheelchair stair climbing device that demonstrated innovation and practicality. We began by presenting our deeper thoughts on this topic to the mentor, outlining its potential applications, scenarios, and proposed solutions for potential issues. Additionally, the mentor pointed out any flaws or shortcomings in our thought process.</li>

        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>In this meeting, the teacher gave a brief evaluation of the three solutions proposed by our group. He pointed out that for the graduation project, it is necessary to clearly define the functions to be used and design from a functional perspective. We discussed with the teacher in depth the first solution - an external wheelchair assistance device. The teacher pointed out that we can have multiple functional designs and provide multiple solutions, gradually eliminating some of them during the continuous design process, Only then can we obtain the final graduation project, while other team members can complete more analysis papers based on the eliminated plan. At the end of this meeting, the teacher asked us to determine the three plans and clarify the graduation project we need to do.</li>

        <dt style="font-size: 24px; color: #8B0000; font-weight: bold;">Meeting 04 (09/14/2023) </dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>In this week's meeting, our group discussed the specific design with the teacher, who pointed out that our design plan is too vague, lacking clear ideas and feasibility. He pointed out that we need to clarify the functionality of the design, how these functionalities should be implemented, whether there are multiple solutions, and whether these solutions should be compared in detail. And he provided a reference for the mobile plan of this design, pointing out that we can use wheeled or tracked design. At the end of the meeting, we determined the weekly meeting time to be 3:30 pm on Wednesdays. The teacher also requested us to come up with a specific design plan before the next meeting.</li>
