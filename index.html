        <dd>We are the Catalyst Collective team led by Zhou Xianda, with Xie Zhongqi, Li Xingchi, Xu Yiming, and Yang Jinwang as team members. Our mentor is Professor Zheng Ting.

        <dd>Our group’s design project is an external mounted wheelchair stair climbing device. This device can be installed on traditional wheelchairs, aiming to help elderly people overcome the problem of stairs in areas without wheelchair access and residential buildings without elevators.

        <dd>We recognize that stairs are a huge challenge for people with limited mobility. And our equipment will provide them with a convenient solution. This device adopts advanced technology and can help wheelchair users safely and stably climb and descend stairs.

        <dd>Our device has the following characteristics: firstly, it is externally mounted and can be compatible with various types of traditional wheelchairs, without the need to replace the entire wheelchair. Secondly, our device adopts an intelligent control system that can perform precise operations based on user actions and intentions. In addition, it is equipped with an efficient battery system to ensure long-term use and stability.

        <dd>Our goal is to provide a reliable, safe, and easy-to-use solution that allows people with limited mobility to move and participate in social activities more freely. Through our design, we hope to improve their quality of life and enable them to independently cope with accessibility challenges. Our team will actively develop and test this device, and collaborate with relevant institutions and communities to ensure that our design meets user needs and truly solves their problems with stairs. We believe that through our efforts and innovation, we can bring positive impacts to people with limited mobility and bring more tolerance and care to society.</dd>
