                <li>During our first meeting, our mentor provided us with an overview of key factors to ensure the successful completion of our device’s designated tasks. The mentor also emphasized the importance of understanding the purpose and functionality of the device, and encouraged us to identify and confirm the specific tasks the device needs to accomplish. Through in-depth discussions, we were able to compile detailed descriptions and plans for each component. The process did not involve extensive research but rather relied on the prompts and guidelines provided by the mentor. We believe that this process was necessary to ensure that our device can achieve its objectives and meet the needs of the intended users.</li>

                <li>During the second meeting, we worked together with our mentor to confirm the precise design direction and had in-depth discussions about our overall objectives. We explored various possible solutions and carefully assessed the pros and cons of each option. We also discussed the feasibility of the design, technical requirements, and time constraints. Through collective brainstorming, we arrived at a clear design goal. In this meeting, we selected one out of the three pre-determined topics that best met the requirements for our graduation project, which was the development of an external wheelchair stair climbing device that demonstrated innovation and practicality. We began by presenting our deeper thoughts on this topic to the mentor, outlining its potential applications, scenarios, and proposed solutions for potential issues. Additionally, the mentor pointed out any flaws or shortcomings in our thought process.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>In this meeting, the teacher gave a brief evaluation of the three solutions proposed by our group. He pointed out that for the graduation project, it is necessary to clearly define the functions to be used and design from a functional perspective. We discussed with the teacher in depth the first solution - an external wheelchair assistance device. The teacher pointed out that we can have multiple functional designs and provide multiple solutions, gradually eliminating some of them during the continuous design process, Only then can we obtain the final graduation project, while other team members can complete more analysis papers based on the eliminated plan. At the end of this meeting, the teacher asked us to determine the three plans and clarify the graduation project we need to do.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>In this week's meeting, our group discussed the specific design with the teacher, who pointed out that our design plan is too vague, lacking clear ideas and feasibility. He pointed out that we need to clarify the functionality of the design, how these functionalities should be implemented, whether there are multiple solutions, and whether these solutions should be compared in detail. And he provided a reference for the mobile plan of this design, pointing out that we can use wheeled or tracked design. At the end of the meeting, we determined the weekly meeting time to be 3:30 pm on Wednesdays. The teacher also requested us to come up with a specific design plan before the next meeting.</li>

                <li>According to the teacher's guidance, we realized that our project lacks innovative ideas and should not rely solely on others' achievements. We need to analyze the pros and cons and come up with creative solutions. Damping was suggested as a key area to focus our research on. The teacher emphasized the need to speed up the progress, finalize the wheel structure, and start the detailed design and drawing process within the next week. The teacher advised us to refer to bicycle frames for designing our damping system, which was an insightful suggestion. Importantly, the teacher pointed out that we can have different shapes for the front and rear wheels to convert the vertical vibrations encountered when going up and down stairs into swinging motions. This is because the peak frequencies and timing of vertical wheel movements differ between the front and rear wheels. The teacher also highlighted the pros and cons of the three potential solutions we presented, which is very helpful for advancing our project. We will strive to incorporate these suggestions and contribute to the success of the project.</li>

                <li>We have proposed a preliminary plan for this meeting, as shown below. We have decided to change the normal S-shaped wheel to an S-shaped wheel with three legs. Because this will go upstairs more smoothly without causing significant fluctuations, as shown in the following figure. We have referred to the shock absorption truss structure of bicycles and made some simple improvements to it, which has been integrated with our equipment. Improvements have also been made to the previous non active wheel, triangular wheel. We have borrowed the special damping wheel hub structure of high-end bicycles to achieve the effect of shock absorption in the next wave. And the mentor pointed out that we need to separate the shock absorber from the power wheel, as this will lead to a loss of some power, and there is no particularly perfect shock absorber effect. In addition, the mentor suggested that we refine the overall shock absorption and frame structure, first determining the relevant parameters of the wheelchair, and then determining the size of the wheels to ensure that our frame size is appropriate and the shock absorption is appropriate. He proposed to roughly reverse our shock absorption structure first, which can reduce the length of piston expenditure and be more stable.</li>

                <li>In this meeting, we refined the wheel structure and conducted preliminary calculation, design, and drawing of the dimensions. And communicate our ideas with our supervisor. Our data is too hypothetical, and our supervisor told us that we should think more academically about this issue, and the corresponding key dimensions should be abstracted. And using relevant specified dimensions to calculate the data range, searching for suitable dimensions or verifying the dimensions of some existing components through the data range, is the step that a design process should follow. We have benefited greatly from this. Due to special reasons, we are having an online meeting, but this has not affected our communication at all. The mentor proposed to further refine the structure next time and proposed the concept of three planetary gears for us to think about. And remind us to accelerate the progress.</li>

                <li>In this meeting, we discussed three planetary wheels, and we searched and read many papers to understand this type of wheel. We choose the Three Star wheels' install of the regular triangular wheel and its variants. Because it can better respond to the issue of running on flat ground, reducing the need to retract the wheels. And we will lock the central gear and the plates on both sides when going upstairs, and unlock them when running flat, which may require a type of inclusion. Recording to the national regulations On the size of st Airs and the measured size data of Zhixing Building stairs that we have selected, we will use them to constrain the key dimensions L and r of our wheels Here are some of the inequalities we have already written, and there may be more in the future We will use these inequalities for data validation In addition, our supervisor assigned us a task for this meeting, allowing us to choose to make a simple model using cardboard or wooden boards to test if there are any shortcomings in our inequality and if there are any areas where the structure may get stuck upstairs. Then define each size and provide a 3D modeling diagram. This is what we are discussing in this meeting.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>We first presented our 3D modeling for this meeting. And the dimensions of some key components and standard parts in our modeling are very exquisite. We conducted an online search to ensure that the dimensions we designed can be purchased through certain channels, or that these standard parts that can be purchased meet our design requirements. Below is our modeling and dimensions of key components. In addition, we have taken out a simple proportional model of the cardboard we made last week. And we have tested its feasibility. We replaced the meshing force between gears by simulating the friction force on the side of thick cardboard. Although it was done roughly, it has been basically verified that our size is correct as shown in the following figure. In terms of power verification, we may need to use 3D printed miniature models for actual verification or simplify our model and perform motion simulation in adms for verification. In this meeting, the teacher proposed that our design seems to be not feasible in terms of sports. After detailed discussion, we have decided to add an additional set of gears between the gear of the large wheel and the center gear, as shown in the following figure. Initially, adding a set of gears between the center gear and the outer gear was to ensure that the size of the gears could be slightly smaller, then meeting Inequalities to ensure that the center gear would not hit the edge of the step when the wheel rolled up the stairs But this design will result in consistent rotation direction of the central gear when running on flat ground and when running upstairs To determine when to change the direction of the motor, some detection equipment may be needed to determine when it touches a step, or manual control by a person in a wheelhair is required This is what we don't want So we decided the best approach would be to add a set of gears But this means we need to re model. In addition, we also need to do our best to do well in motion simulation.</li>

                <li>During the actual testing process, we found that the middle part of our board still had a tendency to collide with the stairs. This requires us to change its size or choose to change the size of the wheels. Moreover, more importantly, we realize that the biggest problem of using a Samsung wheel to go upstairs is starting to surface. We initially believed that the problem with only one set of intermediate gears was that running on flat ground and running on stairs would result in a difference in forward and reverse rotation of the central gear, so we added a set of gears. However, in real practice, it has been found that no matter how many sets of gears are added, forward rotation and reverse rotation are inevitable, because forward rotation and reverse rotation are determined by the nature of the gears themselves. This mode of reverse rotation needs to be consistent with the rotation direction of the gears that are coaxial with the wheel and mesh with it, which is impossible. This is the biggest problem we have encountered and urgently needs to be solved.</li>

                <li>Due to many design issues in the first half of our senior year, and the continuous improvement process, the physical situation has become increasingly complex. Therefore, we have decided to adopt a new upstairs structure and method. The basic wheelchair structure is shown in the following figure and has been purchased.

            <ul>
                <li>The structure of stepping up the stairs is based on the flipping of the rocker arm and the contact with the steps, so the size (radius) of the rocker arm must be larger than the wheel (radius) of the wheelchair's rear wheel. We use different axis methods to achieve this process, because we only need to allow the movement of the rocker arm to exceed the radius of the rear wheel below the wheelchair. However, the size of the rear wheel of the wheelchair frame is too large, so we have purchased new wheels (smaller than the rocker arm size), as shown in the picture. The reason for using inflatable wheels is that it is inevitable that the rear wheels will collide with the steps during the process of stepping up the stairs, which we do not want. The use of inflatable wheels can appropriately reduce vibration.</li>

The controller includes a switch that can switch between up and down stairs mode (rocker arm forward and reverse), a knob to adjust speed, and finally a simple display screen that displays the remaining voltage and power in conjunction with the battery. For the convenience of operation, we placed the button for controlling the movement of the rocker arm (whether it is powered on or not) on a handrail, and designed it in a form that can adjust the height (length). We realized that the appropriate height of the wheelchair is often not suitable when running on flat ground, and longer handrails are needed during the process of going up and down, as shown in the figure.</li>
